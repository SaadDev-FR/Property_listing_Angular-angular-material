# Property_lesting_skills_test
  This project is skills test and i have implement property listing and it's details by using angular,angular material, json server, and rxjs subject.
  When user clicks on any product user will redirect to details page by using product id and sending this id as argument to endpoint to get product details aganist 
  the product.We have implement the rxjs subject to communicate between header component and landing page component to toggle the view i.e card view/ table view.There are only 4 products i have added but it shows dynamically, I mean if 30 products in DB then it will display 30 if 60 then sixty.
  
  First of all clone the repository by using this link (https://github.com/saad5112/Property_lesting_skills_test.git)
  **Command** 
  git clone https://github.com/saad5112/Property_lesting_skills_test.git
  **Node Modules**
   I have not added the node modules in git repository so, you will use **npm install** before this command "ng serve/npm start" command to serve the app on bowser.   
## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
